# How we Built it
In order to build any application or software first, we need to understand what the project wants from us. So we first analysed the problem statement, then in our group discussion we all proposed some ideas out of which some were rejected while others were brainstormed upon.

Before getting into coding we made wireframes for how our site should look and what our API structure and database schemas should look like. This visual representation enabled us to understand exactly what is happening and how we are going to achieve it. Then gradually we moved forward and piece by piece developed the application.

The application is built using the MERN stack and has used best coding practices and code structure which are prevalent in the software industry. While building the application, we tested it thoroughly like we checked whether each page is behaving properly and we tested each test case that we made, we also tested all APIs using Postman.
